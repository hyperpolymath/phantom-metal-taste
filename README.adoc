== Overview

*Phantom Metal Taste* is an advanced multi-model database architecture designed to capture, analyze, and visualize the complex relationship between corporate initiatives and their outcomes.

The project leverages cutting-edge graph and semantic database technologies, implemented in a modern functional programming language (ReScript) and secure runtime (Deno), to model organizational dynamics with unprecedented fidelity.

> *"The taste of metal in your mouth when nothing is there—a phantom sensation that feels undeniably real yet fundamentally wrong."*

== Technical Architecture

This project employs a sophisticated polyglot stack:

- *ReScript*: Type-safe functional programming language (compiles to JavaScript)
- *Deno*: Secure JavaScript/TypeScript runtime with modern tooling
- *ArangoDB*: For graph-based modeling of causal relationships
- *Virtuoso*: For semantic web ontologies and formal knowledge representation
- *Rust/WebAssembly*: For high-performance core logic
- *Julia*: For advanced statistical analysis

== Why ReScript + Deno?

*ReScript* provides:
- *Sound type system* - impossible states are unrepresentable
- *100% type coverage* - if it compiles, it works
- *Functional paradigm* - immutable, pure functions
- *Fast compilation* - ~1ms per file
- *Zero-cost abstractions* - optimized JavaScript output

*Deno* provides:
- *Security first* - explicit permissions model
- *Modern standards* - ES modules, Web APIs
- *Built-in tooling* - test runner, formatter, linter
- *No node_modules* - URL-based imports

See [RESCRIPT_MIGRATION.md](RESCRIPT_MIGRATION.md) for detailed rationale.

== The SynapCor Case Study

Included with this project is a complete case study of "SynapCor," a fictional tech company implementing a data-driven employee wellness program called the "Synergy Matrix." The case study includes:

- Full UML modeling suite (Use Case, Sequence, State Machine diagrams)
- TOGAF-compliant enterprise architecture documentation
- OMG Ontology Definition Metamodel implementation
- Data Flow Diagrams and Entity-Relationship models

This case study serves as both documentation and a demonstration of the system's capabilities.

== Key Features

- *Multi-model persistence*: Store the same conceptual data in different database paradigms to unlock unique analytical capabilities
- *Causal graph traversal*: Follow the explicit links between actions and consequences
- *Semantic reasoning*: Apply formal logic to organizational knowledge
- *Quantified impact analysis*: Measure and visualize the precise effects of organizational decisions
- *Gaming detection*: Statistical analysis to identify manipulated metrics
- *Metric theater detection*: Identify measurements that are never acted upon

== Getting Started

=== Prerequisites

1. *ReScript compiler*:
   ```bash
   npm install -g rescript
   ```

2. *Deno runtime*:
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh
   ```

3. *Docker & Docker Compose*: For databases

=== Quick Start

```bash
= Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/phantom-metal-taste.git
cd phantom-metal-taste

= Build ReScript code
deno task build

= Start the databases (requires Docker)
deno task db:up

= Run the orchestrator
deno task dev
```

See [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for a 5-minute getting started guide.

== The Deeper Question

This project asks a fundamental question: What happens when we apply the full rigor of enterprise architecture, formal modeling, and data science to measure the gap between institutional intent and lived reality?

The answer may leave a curious taste in your mouth.

== Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Before submitting a PR, please ensure:
- ReScript code compiles without warnings
- All tests pass: `deno task test`
- Documentation is updated

== The Meta-Statement

This system measures organizational delusion using the most rigorous tools available:
- Sound type system (ReScript)
- Formal ontologies (OWL/RDF)
- Statistical analysis (Julia)
- Causal graph theory (ArangoDB)

The irony: Building a perfect system to measure imperfect systems.

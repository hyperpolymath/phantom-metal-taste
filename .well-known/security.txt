# Our Approach
# This project prioritizes:
# - Type safety (ReScript sound types)
# - Memory safety (Rust zero-unsafe)
# - Runtime security (Deno permissions)
# - Offline-first (air-gap capable)
# - Supply chain (reproducible builds)
#
# See SECURITY.md for 10-dimensional security model.

# Response Timeline
# - Acknowledgment: 48 hours
# - Initial assessment: 5 business days
# - Fix timeline: Depends on severity (critical: 7 days, high: 30 days)
# - Coordinated disclosure: 90 days from report

# Scope
# In scope:
# - All code in this repository
# - Docker infrastructure
# - Build system (justfile, flake.nix)
# - Dependencies (Deno imports, Rust crates)
#
# Out of scope:
# - Third-party services (ArangoDB, Virtuoso upstream)
# - User-provided data/configurations
# - Physical security

# Bug Bounty
# Currently no formal bug bounty program.
# Recognition and credit provided for responsible disclosure.
# Future bounty program under consideration.
